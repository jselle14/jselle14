<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Jessica</h1>
<h3 align="center">I’m currently studying Graphic Information Technology at Arizona State University.</h3>
🌱 After graduation, I plan to pursue a career as a Full-Stack Web Developer.

🌱 Last semester, I completed the Global Career Accelerator Program at ASU and earned a certification in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

🌱 I also have experience with video editing, as well as Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop, which allow me to bring both technical and creative projects to life.

📖 In my free time, I love getting lost in a good book. Fantasy is my favorite genre, but I enjoy exploring stories of all kinds.
